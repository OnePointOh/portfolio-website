    "description": "This website! I created this website to help highlight my experience in various tools and frameworks. To build this website, I used React. I host this website using a few AWS services including: S3, Route 53, and CloudFront. I wanted to make it easy to add or remove project pages, so each project is coded as a JSON file that gets read and formatted by the React App. This website uses stylized components from MUI.",
