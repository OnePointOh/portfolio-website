    "description": "The TAMU Class Availability Checker is a Python-based tool designed to help students monitor the availability of classes at Texas A&M University (TAMU). By sending HTTP GET requests to TAMU's class schedule pages and parsing the returned HTML, the program checks for open spots in desired classes. When a class becomes available, it sends a text notification to the user. The tool is configured through a config.ini file, allowing users to specify the term, class codes, notification settings, and preferred phone carrier. The project is particularly useful for students who need to act quickly to secure a spot in high-demand classes, providing a convenient way to stay updated on class availability without manual checks.
